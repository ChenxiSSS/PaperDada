Title: Surface brightness fluctuation of ICM caused by AGN activities

Intro:
* AGN feedback in the ICM;
    * Turbulence by AGN at 50-100 kpc scale;
* Previous studies of AGN activities vs ICM;
    * Observational evidence on AGN imprint on the ICM; 
    * Simulation/theoretical prediction on AGN imprint on the ICM;
* AGN acts on ICM -> previously unknown;
* AGN activities around outskirt (0.45 R500) if applicable;

Methodology:
* Sample selection;
    * Selection rules;
        * FOV coverage upto 0.45 R500, hence it is the sub-sample of Zhu et al. 2020
        * No clear merger feature;
        * End up with a subsample of memeber with clear AGN activity, and a sample without
        clear AGN activity.
* Sample info;
    * Sample #1 with AGN;
        * AGN literature check;
        * Table of the cnetral BCG, its AGN properties, X-ray flux, radio flux, & optical flux;
        * QA: checking if there are any known power AGNs within the FOV;
    * Sample #2 without AGN;
        * AGN literature check;
        * Table of the cnetral BCG, its AGN properties, X-ray flux, radio flux, & optical flux;
        * QA: checking if there are any known power AGNs within the FOV;
* Data reduction;
    * Chandra data reduction;
* Data analysis:
    * Filling gaps;
    * Rescale with Beta model;
    * Wavelet transformation basic;
    * Transformation detail;

Results:
* Output maps;
* Comparing the two subsample to see if there are differences;
    * Whether or not there extis AGN contribution to the clumping or fluctuation of the ICM;
    * Whether or not there exits AGN contribution at the outskirt;

Discussion:
* Atributions to the results;
    * The contribution of the AGN activities;
* Error discussion;
    * Analysis error;
        * Filling gap;
        * Wavelet;
        * Sub/div Beta model;
* On individual sources (if applicable).

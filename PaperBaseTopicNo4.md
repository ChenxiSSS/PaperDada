### Title
Surface Brightness Fluctuation of the Intra-Cluster Medium Caused by AGN Activities

#### Intro
* AGN feedback in the ICM;
    * Turbulence by AGN at 50-100 kpc scale (check the reference & citation of Zhuravleva et al. 2015);
* Previous studies of AGN activities vs ICM;
    * Observational evidence on AGN imprint on the ICM; 
    * Simulation/theoretical prediction on AGN imprint on the ICM;
* AGN acts on ICM -> previously unknown;
* AGN activities around outskirt (0.45 R500) if applicable;

#### Methodology 
* Sample selection;
    * Selection rules;
        * FoV coverage upto 0.45 r500, hence it is the sub-sample of Zhu et al. 2019;
        * exposure time;
        * no clear merger feature;
        * end up with a subsample of memeber with clear agn activity, and a sample without
        clear agn activity;
* Sample info;
    * Subsample #1 with AGN:
        * AGN literature check;
        * table of the cnetral BCG, its AGN properties, x-ray flux, radio flux, & optical flux;
        * QA: checking if there are any known power AGNs within the FoV;
    * Subsample #2 without AGN:
        * AGN literature check;
        * table of the cnetral BCG, its AGN properties, x-ray flux, radio flux, & optical flux;
        * QA: checking if there are any known power AGNs within the FoV;
* Data reduction;
    * The standard Chandra data reduction pipeline;
* Data analysis:
    * Spherically-symmetric beta model;
    * Power-spectrum:
        * Delta-variance method;
        * Possion noise PS correction;
        * PSF PS correction;
        * 2D-to-3D PS convertion;
    * Clumping factor;
    * Feedback power;

#### Results
* PS & Clumping factor figures;
* Infer a conclusion whether or not there extis AGN contributions to ICM:
    * via the power spectrum map;
    * via clumping factor calculation;
* Infer a conclusion whether or not there exits AGN contribution at the outskirt;
* Infer whether or not there exits a relation with AGN feedback power and the AGN contribution;

#### Discussions
* Systematic uncertainties;
* Clumping factor comparisons:
    * Internal comparison: compare the sample averaged clumping factor between the two sub-samples;
        * Clear difference between the two -> explainations;
        * No clear difference between the two -> explainations;
    * External comparison: compare the sample averaged clumping factor with the simulation results;
        * Clear match or no clear match with the simulation and explaination;
* AGN feedback power discussion;
* On individual sources (if applicable).
